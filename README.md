# Film-ranking
Responsive landing page where I rank the top three best Studio Ghibli productions with their description/synopsis and video trailer.


 Tips for the responsive banner:
* Use vh (viewport height) for flexible height.
* Background image: Set with background-size: cover for responsiveness.
* Media queries help adjust text sizes and spacing on smaller screens.
* Flexbox makes centering easier.
